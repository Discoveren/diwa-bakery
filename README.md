### Website Idea

<p>Initially, it was meant to be a filipino bakery/cafe because I was inspired by bakeries' back home in the Philippines. However, while making the website it evolved into a restaurant because I think elevating it into a restaurant it could help push filipino cuisine into a wider audience.</p>
